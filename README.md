# sushi_go_bot

This is a python bot which plays a game called sushi go round. I wanted to make this bot long years before after i saw a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfk_T6VKhTE) on the youtube which inspires me to learn prohgramming. But that time i am learning python and i am new to programming languages. But now i have a made a bot which plays the same game.

You need to resize the browser to fit on the left side. because the program expects the items to be at the exact spot (not accurate).

## How to run this bot
* Download or clone this repo
* cd into the folder
* on terminal run `python3 bot_commands.py`
